Hi! I recently finished my PhD and I am looking for exciting job opportunities as a Data Scientist.

I obtained my PhD at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ under the supervision of Pascal Frossard where I focused on improving the reliability and performance of AI. Prior to that, I worked as a Data Analyst for two years at Kernel Analytics, a consultancy company that got acquired by Boston Consulting Group. Before that, I obtained a double degree of Engineering Physics and Telecommunications with the CFIS grant at the Politechnic University of Catalonia ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸.

I am passionate about discovering patterns in data, following the newest technology and physics discoveries, and learning new things on my own. On that note, I made a webapp for task and habit management to learn React and Redux, made a recipe app for Android to learn Kotlin, and I am currently learning AWS. Apart of that, I love playing the piano and composing music.
